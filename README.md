# bookmark-launcher

Create a simple java script embedded in the Google chrome to open certain websites with pre-defined shortcuts.

1. install the extension of **ShortKeys**, which can define certain shortcuts to run a java script;

2. customize keyboard shortcuts in ShortKeys, and add certain key to run a javascript. Here I put a simple javascript to open youtube. You can copy and paste this function, and bind it with a key combination "ctrl+u", so that whenever you type these keys, your browser will automatically open the youtube.
